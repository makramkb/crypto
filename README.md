In this activity I grouped the data into 3 categories after finding the right k number.

Using KMeans from sklear.cluster I classified the categories after standarizing the data using standartscaler from sklearn.preprocessing

I introduced the PCA concept as well and compressed the columns into 3 PCAs. Arround 75% of explained varience was captured.

PCA provided better classification then applied.
